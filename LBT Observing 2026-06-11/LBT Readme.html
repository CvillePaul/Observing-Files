Program Summary:
Targets are TESS identified eclipsing quadruple systems (2 sets of Eclipsing Binaries, each showing both a Primary and Secondary Eclipse).  

Our goal for this observing session is to obtain unambiguous radial velocity measurements for these systems.
We therefore seek observations when one of the two binary systems is in eclipse and the other is halfway between eclipses.

Calibrations:
Standard PEPSI calibrations.
For accurate sky subtraction, we request a sky fiber be taken at the time of observing. 

Instructions:
The included .pdf files give the observing priority of each system on an hour-by-hour basis.  
For a given UTC day &amp; hour, please observe the target with the highest indicated priority and avoid targets with empty cells.
Please do NOT revisit any target already observed, whether science or calibration target.

There are three types of calibration measurement useful in our program:
1) If possible, please acquire a spectrum, with decent SNR, of the twilight sky.
2) Please observe one or more of the targets listed as RV Standards.  These are best captured at low airmass/higher altitude.
3) Please observe only one of the targets listed as a Telluric Standard.  These are best captured at high airmass/low altitude.

For each of these three types of calibrations, only one measurement is necessary per run - no calibration target benefits from repeat observations.
